\page installation Installation

\section inst_download Download

Download gensrc from the 
<a href="https://bintray.com/quantlib/releases/QuantLibXL/1.13#files">QuantLib downloads page on bintray</a>.

\section inst_installation Installation

To install gensrc simply uncompress the files.  Previous versions of gensrc
required certain environment variables to be set at run time, this is no longer
the case.  gensrc is now delivered as a Python package, and the top level
directory contains the main \c gensrc.py script which automatically loads the
package from subdirectories.

\section inst_usage Usage

To use gensrc, you must configure XML metadata for the required components of
your project - functions, enumerations, etc.  You then invoke \c gensrc.py as
follows:

\verbatim
$python path/to/gensrc/gensrc.py -[flags]
    where [flags] specify that source code is to be generated for any of:
        x - Excel addin
        o - OpenOffice.org Calc addin
        g - Guile addin
        c - C addin
        v - ValueObjects code
        e - Enumerations
        l - Loop typedefs
        d - Doxygen documentation files
    or
        a - All of the above
    or
        h - display this help message
\endverbatim

gensrc usage has not yet been documented in further detail. 
Examples of gensrc usage can be found in the ObjectHandler
and QuantLibAddin projects.

- Bug fix.  In the past, if you called function qlSimpleQuoteSetValue() with an
  invalid value, the call failed.  This led to bugs, if you opened a
  spreadsheet with stale rates, a quote could be set with an input that was
  numerically valid but out of date.  Then if the live value was #NA, the update
  failed, leaving the quote with an old stale value.  Now, if you call
  qlSimpleQuoteSetValue() with an invalid input such as #NA, the quote object is
  invalidated.
  For more information please refer to file
  QuantLibXL\StandaloneExamples\Bugs\qlSimpleQuoteSetValue_BugFix.xlsx.
